## Datasets
### Classification
- [Shelter Animal Outcomes](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes)

## Problem Statement
When a cat or dog enters the shelter system in the United States, the cards can already be stacked against them. Information like age, breed, coloring, gender, neuter/spaying can make a great impact on whether the animal's shelter outcome is a happy one.

Our dataset was from Kaggle and was originally provided by Austin Animal Center and ASPCA. The outcomes that were avaialable for modeling were:
  -  Adoption
  -  Transfer (getting sent to another shelter or a specialty facility)
  -  Returned to owner
  -  Euthanasia
  -  Died

Our goal is to gather insights on the types of animals that are associated with the outcomes, and to model an animals outcome based on their underlying statistics. This classification problem can assist in identifying animals that will be expected to be difficult to adopt out, etc.
